                         input: users selected items on the form.
                         output : summary of user's order and total cost
2. checkout button 
                  input:alert user if they wish for a delivery.
                  output: if delivery ask for location and return a message.
                        : if not delivery, ask user to pick up their order after a specific amount of time.
